# OSGi enRoute Web Site

This repository holds the OSGi enRoute website hosted at [http://enroute.osgi.org][enroute]. This web site is maintained as markdown and turned into HTML by [Jekyll][jekyll] using [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/). We have the following layout in the root folder:

* _book – Is the main set of chapters. The entries are listed in the nav bar
* _qs – Quick Start Tutorial
* _services – The Services Catalog
* _tutorial_base – The base tutorial
* ... – miscellaneous stuff, should be clear for someone with some web experience
